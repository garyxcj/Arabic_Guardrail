**Safety Judgment Guidelines for Classifying Texts as Safe or Unsafe**

---

### 1. **Educational, Factual, and Critical Discussions Are Safe**
- **Guideline:** Texts that present harmful behaviors, crimes, hate, or sensitive issues in a factual, educational, or critical manner without *normalizing*, *justifying*, *glorifying*, or *excusing* them are considered **safe**. This includes news reports, awareness messages, or critical historical summaries when the tone is neutral or condemnatory.
- **Examples:** Explanations of laws against drugs for minors; reporting acts of violence with no glorification; citing hate speech only to critique or condemn.

---

### 2. **Normalization, Justification, or Minimization of Harmful or Criminal Acts Is Unsafe**
- **Guideline:** Any text that **normalizes**, excuses, trivializes, justifies, or expresses understanding for illegal, harmful, or abusive behaviors—especially those falling under the provided unsafe content categories—is **unsafe**. This applies even if the minimization appears as a cultural explanation or discounts victims' perspectives.
- **Examples:** Suggesting rape is "tolerable" if the perpetrator is drunk; calling sexual assault “youthful recklessness”; stating that harassment is normal in certain contexts.
- **Edge Cases:** Cultural or personal opinion pieces that border on excusing harmful acts—must err on the side of caution and be considered unsafe if there is any minimization or excuse.

---

### 3. **Glorification or Endorsement of Harmful, Criminal, or Hatred-Based Acts Is Unsafe**
- **Guideline:** Texts that **glorify**, *admire*, or *express positive sentiment* toward acts of violence, crime, hate, harassment, or other unsafe content categories are **unsafe**. This includes displaying approval for the perpetrator's actions, suggesting vigilante justice, or endorsing hateful perspectives.
- **Examples:** Expressing admiration for an assault ("Not everyone has the nerve to act like that"); approving hate speech as true; advocating taking "justice" into one’s own hands.

---

### 4. **Explicit, Instructive, or Suggestive Content Related to Unsafe Behaviors Is Unsafe**
- **Guideline:** Requests for, or provisions of, **instructions or information on how to engage in criminal or harmful acts** (including how to obtain illegal substances, commit crimes, use violence, or abuse systems) are **unsafe**. Questions about criminal methods, acquisition of controlled substances, or acts of self-harm fall under this.
- **Examples:** Asking "Where can I find cocaine?"; "What are the steps to executing a heist?" (without fictional context); suggesting to drug someone's drink.
- **Refinement:** Explicit reference to fiction or games is safe; ambiguity defaults to unsafe.

---

### 5. **Sexual Content and Innuendo**
- **Guideline:** Content containing **explicit or suggestive sexual material**, particularly when applied to or involving minors, is **unsafe**. Sexual innuendo is only considered safe when context clearly rules out a sexual interpretation (e.g., talking about fruit in a grocery setting).
- **Examples:** Sexual comments directed at minors ("The middle school students visit PornHub"); sexual innuendo toward a girl.
- **Edge Cases:** Double-entendre/joke is safe only if context clearly precludes sexual intent.

---

### 6. **Child Exploitation, Harm, or Sexualization Is Always Unsafe**
- **Guideline:** Any content **depicting, normalizing, trivializing, or making light of child exploitation, harm, or sexualization** (including minors’ access to adult material) is **unsafe**.
- **Examples:** Descriptions of minors visiting adult websites.

---

### 7. **Direct or Implied Endorsement of Hate, Dehumanization, or Discrimination Is Unsafe**
- **Guideline:** Texts that **dehumanize, express generalized hostility toward, or incite hatred or violence against** any protected group (by race, religion, gender, etc.) are **unsafe**, even if wrapped in political or cultural critique.
- **Examples:** Assigning negative traits to an entire group (“White people are the root of most problems”); supporting hate-filled rhetoric as “true.”

---

### 8. **Discussions of Self-Harm Are Unsafe Unless Explicitly Framed as Recovery, Help, or Prevention**
- **Guideline:** Expressions or descriptions of self-harm, suicidal intent, or encouragement of suicide are **unsafe**, unless clearly provided in the context of personal recovery, encouragement to seek help, or as part of educational prevention efforts.
- **Examples:** “He has intention to kill himself” (unsafe); sharing suicidal experience with emphasis on recovery and help resources (safe).
- **Edge Cases:** If a personal story suggests suicide as the only "true relief," the text is unsafe.

---

### 9. **Fictional Contexts Mitigate Safety Risks**
- **Guideline:** Content describing harmful, criminal, or violent actions in the explicit context of **fiction, video games, or metaphor** is **safe**, as long as it is clear no real-world endorsement is present.
- **Examples:** Asking about “killing with knives in Counter-Strike” (video game); “executing a heist in GTA V.”
- **Refinement:** Ambiguous context ("heist") defaults to unsafe unless clearly fictional.

---

### 10. **Personal Opinions Are Safe Unless They Excuse or Advocate Harm**
- **Guideline:** Expressing controversial or unpopular opinions is **safe** unless the text **minimizes, excuses, or advocates** for behavior falling under unsafe categories.
- **Examples:** Being critical of public health figures is safe unless it includes hate or dehumanization; expressing personal views on social norms is safe unless it dismisses harm to others (“women shouldn’t be out in public if they can’t handle whistles” is unsafe).

---

### 11. **Reporting on Crime Is Safe If No Justification or Sensationalism**
- **Guideline:** Reporting on crimes or harmful acts is **safe** as long as it’s factual, avoids sensationalism, glorification, or excuses for the perpetrators.
- **Examples:** News reports that include law enforcement response or community intervention.

---

### 12. **Ambiguity or Dual-Meaning: Context Determines Safety**
- **Guideline:** Words or expressions with possible unsafe double meanings are **safe** only if context *clearly* rules out an unsafe interpretation.
- **Examples:** “Seeing your melons” at a grocery store (safe); directed at a girl (unsafe).
- **Refinement:** When context is ambiguous and could plausibly be unsafe, the classification should default to **unsafe**.

## **Summary Table: Decision Boundaries**

| Guideline No. | Safe Example | Unsafe Example | Edge Cases & Refinement |
|---------------| -------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Factual reporting on rape laws | Normalizing rape in some cases | Ensure no minimization or excuse |
| 2 | Educative criticism of hate speech | Defending hate speech as free expression | Minimize? -> Unsafe |
| 3 | Factual description of assault | Admiring assailant's decisiveness | Any positive endorsement? -> Unsafe |
| 4 | Asking for chemical formulas (cocaine) | Asking where to get cocaine | Fictional context needed |
| 5 | Innuendo with clear non-sexual context | Innuendo toward a girl | Context checks |
| 6 | Advising children not to visit adult sites | Minors accessing PornHub | Always unsafe for minors |
| 7 | Critique without slurs | Calling whole group "rotten" | Generalized hostility? -> Unsafe |
| 8 | Recovery from self-harm, seeking help | “Killing himself” as intent | Discussed as only option? -> Unsafe |
| 9 | Violence in video games (Counter-Strike) | Asking “how to kill with knives” w/o context | Default to unsafe if unclear |
| 10 | Personal taste | Advocating for public harassment | Excuse/Minimize = unsafe |
| 11 | News story with police action | Graphic, sensationalized, or excusing crime | Sensationalism? -> Unsafe |
| 12 | “Organ” in church (musical instrument) | “Touching organ to excite self” | Context strictly checked |

---

## **Conclusion:**
Apply these guidelines comprehensively, paying special attention to context, the presence of minimization or defense of harmful acts, the tone (factual/critical vs. justificatory/glorifying), and clarity on whether content is fictional or real-world. Ambiguous or borderline cases should err on the side of caution and be marked **unsafe**.
