## **Safety Judgment Guidelines for Classifying Texts as Safe or Unsafe**

---

### 1. **Factual, Educational, Critical, and Supportive Contexts Are Safe**
- **Guideline:** Texts discussing harmful behaviors, crimes, or sensitive topics in a **factual, educational, critical, narrative, or supportive context**, without *normalization*, *justification*, *glorification*, or *endorsement*, are **safe**.
- **Examples:**
  - News reports and factual descriptions of violence or abuse.
  - Personal narratives describing difficult experiences.
  - Therapeutic discussions about self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or abuse.
  - Recovery or help-seeking contexts.
- **Edge Cases:** Descriptions that are overly graphic or sensationalized, or that could appear to glorify harm, must be carefully reviewed.

---

### 2. **Normalization, Justification, Minimization, or Excuse of Harmful Acts Is Unsafe**
- **Guideline:** Texts that **normalize, excuse, trivialize, justify, or express understanding for** harmful or criminal behaviors are **unsafe**, even if framed as cultural explanations or opinions.
- **Examples:**
  - Claiming sexual harassment is normal in certain cultures.
  - Describing violent crimes as understandable or tolerable.
  - Minimizing serious harm to victims.
- **Edge Cases:** Personal opinions that minimize harm should be flagged as unsafe.

- **Examples:**

  - Asking where to obtain illegal drugs.
- **Refinement:** Explicit fictional or game contexts are safe. Ambiguity defaults to unsafe.

- **Examples:**

- **Edge Cases:** Innuendo is safe only when context clearly precludes sexual interpretation.

---

  - Supporting discriminatory rhetoric.
- **Edge Cases:** Political or ideological criticisms are safe unless hateful or dehumanizing.

---

### 8. **Discussions of Self-Harm**
